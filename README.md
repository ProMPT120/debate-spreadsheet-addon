The documentation to the add-on specifically isn't available yet as it is being developped by 1 person. The source code has some comments to ease up the understanding. However most of the code was written due to the really well documented library of Google for [Google Developers spreadsheet](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/).
# Installation
The add-on should be approved and made available via the google add-on gallery.
